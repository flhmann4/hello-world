# hello-world
Hello and welcome to my GitHub account!
I have been coding for a while but need to focus on business projects. I would like to have a career in software development, and so this will be where my more professional projects will live.
For now I will be building websites so that I feel comfortable in my knowledge of them. Beyond this, I will hopefully help communities in need with my skills through volunteering or branch into freelance work to gain experience. This is something I would like to do by Spring 2021, so I may be prepared for college graduation.
