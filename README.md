# hello-world
hello friends i am making an account here yes thank you thank you
I have been coding for a while but need to focus on career development so that I may be a fine professional in the world of technology.
For now I will be building websites so that I feel comfortable in my knowledge of them. Beyond this, I will hopefully help communities in need with my skills through volunteering or branch into freelance work to gain experience. This is something I would like to do by Spring 2021, so I may be prepared for the Big Boy world.
